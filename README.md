# CIS375 UI Project

The Process-Based Estimation Assistant is designed to assist software engineers, project managers, and teams in generating reliable time and resource estimates for software development projects. This document delineates the data design, architectural framework, interface design, and detailed component-level design that collectively form the foundation of the Process-Based Estimation Assistant software.


The primary goal of the Process-Based Estimation Assistant is to streamline the estimation process in software project management by offering a user-friendly interface and a robust back-end algorithm that can handle complex estimation models. The objectives of the Process-Based Estimation Assistant include:

To reduce the time required to create accurate estimations for software development projects.
To provide a collaborative platform for team members to contribute to and refine project estimations.
To integrate with existing project management tools to ensure a seamless workflow.
To offer educational support to users unfamiliar with estimation processes through an integrated online help system.
