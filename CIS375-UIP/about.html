            The Process-Based Estimation Assistant is a tool designed to aid project managers in the task decomposition phase for estimation purposes. The assistant guides the user through the process of breaking down a project into individual tasks and prompts for effort estimates for each task. The following page will display a table with a list of tasks at the top the top. The user will have the choice of adding and deleting in as many functions needed to cater to their project. Once thats set they will enter in estimated effort points for each task and hit calculate which will then show the % effort for each task.
